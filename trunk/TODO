* Actions collision detection
   Classifid in types:
   - redirect
   1. Only actions of type regexp or wildcard may coexist.
   2. Make sure actions of manual redirection rules are of type regexp or wildcard
   - request_header & response_header
      More complex here, some headers are not available to Redirector,
      where others may collide.
