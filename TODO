* Actions collision detection
   Classifid in types:
   - redirect
   1. Only actions of type regexp or wildcard may coexist.
   2. Make sure actions of manual redirection rules are of type regexp
   or wildcard
   - request_header & response_header
      More complex here, some headers are not available to Redirector,
      where others may collide.
* Data validate on saving
* Fast matching rule
   event.addRules error handling
* Redirect loop in RE2
* URL info in header
   Expose URL info to header settings, e.g. define special expression
   to represent the host part of that URL.
* Auto sync
   Trigger scheduled update with chrome.alarms
* Debugger
   chrome.devtools.network is suitable for recording network logs,
   while chrome.devtools.panels suitable to show the result.
* Reuse URL from rule editor to verify expressions in action editor
